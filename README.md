Installation

Python 3.6 + required
Following packages (channel::package) with all the dependencies need to be installed:
* conda-forge::python-sounddevice (numpy will be installed as dependency)
* only for macs: tkmacosx (that needs to be installed through pip3: pip3 install tkmacosx)

Training files are supercheck partials or call history files from N1MM thus the trainging will be on callsignes or exchange messages. However the same way one can form any text file. For example the most common 100 words or anything one desires. Another example can be exchanges for specific contests, letters, numbers, mix and groups. 

Info

This is somewhat similar to RufzXP I wanted for myself on Mac. Though since it python it should work on Widnows and Linux.
