Installation

Python 3.6 + required
Following packages (channel::package) with all the dependencies need to be installed:
* conda-forge::pydub
* conda-forge::python-sounddevice
* tkmacosx (that needs to be installed through pip3: pip3 install tkmacosx)

Training files are supercheck partials from N1MM thus the trainging will be on callsignes. However the same way one can form any text file. For example the most common 100 words or anything you desire. Another example can be exchanges for specific contests

Info

This is somewhat similar to RufzXP I wanted for myself on Mac. Thus it is Mac specific. Won't work on Windows/Linux as it is
